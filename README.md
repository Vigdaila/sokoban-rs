This is a sokoban-like game written in rust with [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) game engine.

The project was inspired by this [tutorial](https://sokoban.iolivia.me/c02-05-gameplay.html), it uses [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) engine, but also utilize [spesc](https://github.com/amethyst/specs) ecs library as Amethyst do.
